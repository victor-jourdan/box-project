# This is our project on minimal absent words

Armand and Victor 

The working files are:â€¯
- zero_try, which is the naive algorithm for the first question, which can be used as below: 
 - Usage: python zero_try.py <output file path (will add the number of the sequence and .tsv at the end)> <sequences file path> <kmax> <optional: maximum number of sequences>
- first_try, an improvement for the first question, which can be used as below: 
 - Usage: python first_try.py <output file path (will add the number of the sequence and .tsv at the end)>  <sequence file path> <kmax> <optional: maximal number of sequences>


- psecond_try, an improvement for the second question, which can be used as below:
 - Usage: python psecond_try.py <output file path (will add the .tsv at the end)> <sequences file path> <kmax> <p> <optional: maximum number of sequences>

 
 
- Time spent on the project : 
Armand : 3 - 5h
Victor : 25 - 30h
